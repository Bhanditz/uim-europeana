design:
- Execution & ActiveExecution: perhaps extend Execution instead and add a state enum to it?
- better name for the RecordProvider contract
- maybe a better name for UimEntity? MetaDataRecord, Collection, Provider, ... are all data sets of some sort --> DataSet?

funtionality:
- implementation of the ProcessingContainer (see FIXMEs)

configuration:
- take a look at the root POM.xml for the karaf version, we have 1.4.0 there instead of 2.1.0 and probably the old artifacts
- clean up dependencies, probably we have duplicated declarations

testing:
- unit tests for the orchestration components (WorfklowProcessor, UIMOrchestrator, StepProcessor)
- write more integration tests now that we have them working
