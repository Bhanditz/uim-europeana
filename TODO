in progress
===========

- mongodb storage:
  - review MDR interface design, see commented out part of the StorageEngine unit test of the mongo module

functionality:
==============

- GUI:
  - New execution
    - better labels / clearer steps
    - later: display total number of MDRs on collection selection
  - Overview
    - past executions: only list of 10 past executions
    - "execution details" button --> execution details view
    - later: link to view with full history
  - Execution detail view (refreshed every N seconds)
    - steps / plugins (later: on click, detail of plugin)
    - tasks in queue per step
  - general:
    - make GUI more robust against backend failures
    - better way to redeploy GWT module to OSGI environment
       - Pax Runner is outdated there, not sure what we can do
    - GWT integration in Karaf Webconsole? (maybe not necessary)

- orchestrator:
  - workflow bundles
  - command interface orchestrator:
    - pause
    - cancel
    - show status
  - later: gracefully handle other services becoming unavailable (e.g. storage, ...)

- storage: MangoDB-based implementation
  - optimize it
  - the unit test takes like forever because we re-built a whole db every time. we may wanna take a different approach and delete
    the records instead

- core plugins:
  - meta data mapping / conversion
  - URL checker
  - thumbnail downloader
  - ...

- GUI:
  - OsgiManager in Apache Karaf / webconsole


design:
=======

- maybe a better name for UimEntity? MetaDataRecord, Collection, Provider, ... are all data sets of some sort --> DataSet?

- prioritisation:
  - add priority level in the Request?
  - how to inform the orchestrator that a priority changed?

- rollback of an execution / request
  - for now, do not do a rollback, but do a clean


configuration:
==============
- clean up dependencies, probably we have duplicated declarations (mvn dependency:analyze)

testing:
========
- unit test for ProcessingContainer / parallel execution
