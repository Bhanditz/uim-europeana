design:
- Execution & ActiveExecution: perhaps extend Execution instead and add a state enum to it?
  semanitcally, there is a difference between both of them, and from a functional perspective it would be good to be able
  to retrieve e.g. the ProgressMonitor for an execution, unless we give that responsibility to the Orchestrator itself?
- better name for the RecordProvider contract
- maybe a better name for UimEntity? MetaDataRecord, Collection, Provider, ... are all data sets of some sort --> DataSet?

funtionality:
- orchestrator: SavePoints
- storage: MangoDB-based implementation
- core plugins:
  - meta data mapping / conversion
  - URL checker
  - thumbnail downloader
  - ...

configuration:
- take a look at the root POM.xml for the karaf version, we have 1.4.0 there instead of 2.1.0 and probably the old artifacts
- clean up dependencies, probably we have duplicated declarations

testing:
- unit test for ProcessingContainer / parallel execution
- unit tests for the orchestration components (WorfklowProcessor, UIMOrchestrator, StepProcessor)
- write more integration tests now that we have them working
