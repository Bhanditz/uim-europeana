in progress
===========

functionality:
==============

- GUI:
  - New execution
    - later: display total number of MDRs on collection selection
  - Overview
  - Execution detail view (refreshed every N seconds)
    - display detail of ProcessingContainers
  - general:
    - make GUI more robust against backend failures
    - better way to redeploy GWT module to OSGI environment
       - Pax Runner is outdated there, not sure what we can do
    - GWT integration in Karaf Webconsole? (maybe not necessary)

- orchestrator:
  - make timeout for task configurable
  - error handling on task timeout
  - cleanup failed tasks after N iterations
  - command interface orchestrator:
    - show status
  - later: gracefully handle other services becoming unavailable (e.g. storage, ...)

- reporting / statistics component
  - trace the time a plugin needs to process a MDR
  - ... (design this)

- storage: MangoDB-based implementation
  - optimize it
  - the unit test takes like forever because we re-build a whole db every time. we may wanna take a different approach and delete
    the records instead

- core plugins:
  - meta data mapping / conversion
  - URL checker
  - thumbnail downloader
  - ...

- GUI:
  - OsgiManager in Apache Karaf / webconsole


design:
=======

- maybe a better name for UimEntity? MetaDataRecord, Collection, Provider, ... are all data sets of some sort --> DataSet?

- mongodb storage:
  - review MDR interface design, see commented out part of the StorageEngine unit test of the mongo module

- prioritisation:
  - add priority level in the Request?
  - how to inform the orchestrator that a priority changed?

- rollback of an execution / request
  - for now, do not do a rollback, but do a clean


configuration:
==============
- clean up dependencies, probably we have duplicated declarations (mvn dependency:analyze)

testing:
========
- unit test for ProcessingContainer / parallel execution
